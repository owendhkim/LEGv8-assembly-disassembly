# LEGv8 Cyclesort / disassembler

Computer Architecture and Machine-Level Programming class project.

Converted cyclesort algorithm in c to LEGv8 assembly language.

Wrote functional disassembler in Java that processes binary file into LEGv8 instructions, using bit-wise operations only.

## Main takeaways

From this project, I was able to understand how arithmetic, data transfer, and logical operations, conditional/uncondtional branches work in machine level.

By converting C code to LEGv8 and writing a LEGv8 disassembler in Java, I was able to learn the difference between low level language and high level language.
As well as their advantages and disadvantages.

I learned that while machine level languages run very efficient and fast because it interacts directly with the hardware, but it lacks abstraction and expressions involving variables, functions, and data structures.
And because of its disadvantages, code in machine level languages tend to be much longer than high level language and it is much harder to debug.

By writing a LEGv8 disassembler in Java, I learned how to handle endianness, how to read bianary input and manipulate them with bit-wise operations.
